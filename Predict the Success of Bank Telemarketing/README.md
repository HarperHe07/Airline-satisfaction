This is the project of IST707 Data Analytics course (SPRING 2019 semester).

The dataset used in this project is called “Bank Marketing Data Set” and can be found at UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Target Variable is variable y, which means if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit.

We propose to use **data mining algorithms** in **R** to predict if a client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit.
The business question we would like to answer is whether or not the customer opted term deposit based on their demographic information and bank’s marketing activities.
Our objective is to seek the most **helpful attributes**, so that bank can pay more attention and put more effort on customers who consist with those factors. 

Five **classification models** (**SVM, random forest, kNN, decision tree** and **Naive Bayes**) are built on the training data to predict whether customers will subscribe a term deposit in RStudio.  

In order to measure the model, some index, like **accuracy rate**, **precision, recall** and **f-measure**, are calculated.
