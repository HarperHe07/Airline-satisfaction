This is the project of IST687 Introduction to Data Science (fall 2018 semester)

We used **R** to perform data analysis and **visualization** for the airline industry customer satisfaction survey dataset. 
The analytic techniques used in this report are **Support Vector Machine**, **Association Rules Mining** and **Linear Modelling**.

The goal of this research is to examine the satisfaction of customers of different airlines and find the **factors** that affect it.
This study is also conducted with two objectives:
1. To explore the level of customers’ satisfaction with different airlines in terms of three dimensions: Customers characteristic, Flight experience characteristic and Flight characteristic
2. To examine the **demographic profile** of the respondents

Some business questions we answered in this project are:
1. Rank the Airlines and find the client’s rank based on the current survey.
2. Find out satisfaction levels of different age groups across airlines.
3. Do people who fly a lot tend to have a higher satisfaction?
4. Compare the various classes based on the customer satisfaction.
5. Do people who depart from/to certain cities have a lower satisfaction rate?
6. Which attribute influence the satisfaction of costumers the most?
