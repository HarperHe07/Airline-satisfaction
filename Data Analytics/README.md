### Course description
Students learn popular data mining methods to gain insight from data and solve complex issues across industries.<br/> 
Students also acquire hands-on experience using current software to develop data mining solutions to scientific and business problems. <br/>
Topics include the key tasks of data mining. Through the exploration of the concepts and techniques of data mining and practical exercises, students will develop skills that can be applied to business, science or other organizational problems. <br/>
Additionally, students will use **R** and **Weka** to perform machine learning across a range of situations when working with structured data (including clustering, classification, decision tree and association rules).
