This is a real job interview question from a data analysis company, and I doubt there is a standard answer to this question. So feel free to explore your story by using the data exploration and transformation techniques appropriately.

Here is a small dataset for you to work with.

Each of 5 schools (A, B, C, D and E) is implementing the same math course this semester, with 35 lessons. There are 30 sections total. The semester is about 3/4 of the way through.

For each section, we record the number of students who are:

•       very ahead (more than 5 lessons ahead)<br/>
•       middling  (5 lessons ahead to 0 lessons ahead)<br/>
•       behind (1 to 5 lessons behind)<br/>
•       more behind (6 to 10 lessons behind)<br/>
•       very behind  (more than 10 lessons behind)<br/>
•       completed (finished with the course)<br/>

What’s the story (or stories) in this data? Find it, and tell it visually and, above all, truthfully.
